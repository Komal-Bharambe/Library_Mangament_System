The Library Management System project is designed to streamline the management and organization of literary resources within a library setting. This project utilizes a sophisticated database management system to catalog books, track their availability, and manage user interactions with the collection. The system is structured around three primary roles: administrators, employees, and users, each with distinct functionalities that ensure efficient operation and resource management.

Administrators have comprehensive control over the system, including the ability to add, update, or remove books, manage user accounts, and oversee the overall functioning of the library. Employees assist in day-to-day operations, such as handling book checkouts, returns, and managing inventory. Users can search for books, reserve them, and track their borrowing history through a user-friendly interface. The system also incorporates features like real-time availability tracking, reservation management, and notification alerts for due dates, ensuring a seamless and organized experience for all stakeholders.
Overall, the Library Management System enhances the efficiency, accessibility, and management of library resources, providing a robust solution for modern library needs
